## Overview

![screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/je-jo/recipe-page/main/images/recipe-page.png)

This looked simple enough, but there's quite a lot going on. I've practiced a bit with CSS grid, and tried to keep a clean and readable code.

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Minireset](https://awesomeopensource.com/project/jgthms/minireset.css?categoryPage=29) - A tiny modern CSS reset. 

## Features

This application/site was created as a submission to a [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges) challenge. The [challenge](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/OEKdUZ6xs0h99C38XVht) was to build an application to complete the following user stories:

- [x] User story: I can see a recipe with ingredients and instructions
- [x] User story: I can select a checkbox if I have the ingredients
- [x] User story: I can see the number of servings, baking times
